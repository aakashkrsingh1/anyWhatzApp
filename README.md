# anyWhatzApp
This project aims at developing a tool to help and save the time of the WhatsApp Power Users who have to constantly save the unimportant WhatsApp contacts. This project aims to provide them the most lightweight UI, to avoid this wastage of time and hassle. I used the basic tools of WhatsApp API, while actively learning concepts like CSS, JavaScript and JQuery which I didnâ€™t previously know; for the Website Development.
